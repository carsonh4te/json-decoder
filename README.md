## Appendix

Your appendix is located in the lower right part of your abdomen, in an area that doctors refer to as McBurney’s point. If applying pressure on McBurney’s point results in pain or tenderness, your doctor may suspect that you have appendicitis.

The finger-shaped appendix is attached to a part of your large intestine called the cecum — a small pouch typically considered to be the beginning of the large intestine.

It’s been unclear what role the appendix has in the body, and removal of the organ doesn’t appear to have any negative health consequences. For many years, scientists believed the appendix was a vestigial organ — one that lost its original function through centuries of evolution.

Anyways...
